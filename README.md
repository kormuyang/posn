# POSN Computer

Hi everyone! This repo was intentionally made as a guideline for competing in POSN Computer.
<br><br>

## Roadmap

This is the rough roadmap showing what you need to do.

1. Master the Language (C/C++)
2. Understand Analysis of Algorithms
3. [Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](#curriculum-dsa)
4. Practice Problems
5. Compete in Online Contests
<br>

## Curriculum: DSA

This is the most significant part because DSA is the main content taught in the camp.

### Part: Data Structures

The following table shows all contents for data structures in the order in which each should be completed.

| Order | Content | Material |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Array | [03-array](materials/03-array/) |
| 2 | Linked List | [09-linked-list](materials/09-linked-list/) |
| 3 | Stack, Queue, & Deque | [10-stack-queue-deque](materials/10-stack-queue-deque/) |
| 6 | Graph | [14-graph](materials/14-graph/) |
| 7 | Disjoint Set Union (DSU) | |
| 8 | Tree | |
| 9 | Binary Search Tree (BST) | |
| 10 | Heap (Priority Queue) | |
| 11 | Trie | |
| 12 | Segment Tree | |
| 13 | Fenwick Tree | |
