# POSN Computer

Hi everyone! This repo was intentionally made as a guideline for competing in POSN Computer.
<br><br>

## Roadmap

This is the rough roadmap showing what you need to do.

1. Master the Language (C/C++)
2. Understand Analysis of Algorithms
3. [Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)](#curriculum-dsa)
4. Practice Problems
5. Compete in Online Contests
<br>

## Curriculum: DSA

This is the most significant part because DSA is the main material taught in the camp.

### Part: Data Structures

The following table shows all materials for data structures in the order in which each should be completed.

| Order | Material | Link |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1 | Array | [03-array](materials/03-array/) |
| 2 | Linked List | [09-linked-list](materials/09-linked-list/) |
| 3 | Stack, Queue, & Deque | |
| 4 | Tree | |
| 5 | Binary Search Tree (BST) | |
| 6 | Heap (Priority Queue) | |
| 7 | Trie | |
| 8 | Graph | |
| 9 | Disjoint Set Union (DSU) | |
| 10 | Segment Tree & Fenwick Tree | |
<br>

### Part: Algorihms

The following table shows all materials for algorithms in the order in which each should be completed.

| Order | Material | Link |

| 1 | Mathematics | [01-mathematics](materials/01-mathematics/) |
| 2 | Bitwise Algorithms | [02-bitwise-algorithms](materials/02-bitwise-algorithms/) |
| 3 | Recursion | [04-recursion](materials/04-recursion/) |
| 4 | Searching | [05-searching](materials/05-searching/) |
